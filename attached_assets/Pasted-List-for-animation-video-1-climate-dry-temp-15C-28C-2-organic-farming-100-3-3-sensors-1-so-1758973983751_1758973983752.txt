List for animation video 
1) climate - dry temp 15C-28C
2) organic farming -100% 3
3) sensors 
1) soil moisture and temp sensors (0–100% VWC) 
purpose-Detects soil water content and temperature to automate irrigation scheduling and prevent
overwatering (major cause of soil erosion in hills).
Working Principle
*measure dielectric premitivity of soil.

2)Soil pH Sensor (Industrial Grade)
*purpose-•Electrochemical sensor measures hydrogen ion concentration → outputs pH value.(pH 3 – 10)
working priciple:
* Electrochemical sensor measures hydrogen ion concentration → outputs pH value

3)NPK Soil Nutrient Sensor (0–1999 mg/kg)
purpose-Uses ion-selective electrodes or spectroscopy to detect nutrient ions.
working priciple-Uses ion-selective electrodes or spectroscopy to detect nutrient ions

4)Flow Sensor(1 – 60 L/min (customizable))
*purpose-Prevents water wastage and ensures each terrace receives adequate water.
*Critical for automated pump shut-off when there’s no water flow.
working priciple-Turbine inside sensor rotates as water passes → generates pulse signal proportional to flow
rate.

5).Pressure Sensor(Range 0 – 6 bar)
*purpose-Flow sensors alone can’t differentiate between low source water and pipe blockage
*Ensures safe operation of pumps and valves

6). Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge(Temp Range -40°C to +80°C)
*purpose-Avoids over-irrigation during natural rainfall
*Helps predict soil erosion risk on steep slopes.

7)Temperature & Humidity Sensor (Range - Up to 20m)
*purpose-Microclimate in hilly areas can vary terrace-to-terrace.
*Helps in decision-making for crop health and irrigation frequency

8). Ultrasonic Level Transmitter(Range - Up to 20m)
purpose-*Farmers need to track tank storage to avoid overflow and wastage during heavy rains
*Critical for optimizing irrigation during dry spells.
*Automatically refill tanks or stop pumps to avoid overflow.
working priciple-Sends ultrasonic pulse → measures time for echo return to calculate water level.
4). APP (connected to app) 
- loacal language, voice feature, automated irrigation, automated manure supply,soil health, offline features 
5).water harvesting
6). manure pit 
* connected to app 
7).electricity
8).offline 
9).normal range of nutrients and nutrients present in your soil 
10). Send alert message about soil health and crops health and also alert message for weather
why our app is best  
ALL THESE ARE PROVIDED IN OFFLINE MODE … IT ALSO SAVES MONEY OF FARMERS( UNNECESSARY RECHAGING THEIR PHONE/INTERNET) ALSO EVERYTHING LIKE IRRIGATION TO PROVIDING MANURE (100% organic) TO SOIL EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATED ALSO VOICE IN LOCAL LANGUAGE AND LOCAL LANGUANGE IN APP
